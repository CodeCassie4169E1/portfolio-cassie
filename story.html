    <h1>How I got here</h1>
    <p class="work text-center">
      This story begins with a very ambitious young woman who wants to be a
      hairdresser. After high school, I attended Stewarts School for Cosmetology
      and became a stylist specializing in male haircuts. After a wonderful ten
      year career of doing hair and owning my booth, I was curious about what
      else I could learn. A vague sales position ad drew me into the technology
      field. There I spent most of seven years leading the technical support
      team of an audio video manufacturer. Growing individuals from the place
      they were to the place they wanted to be was my passion. I found joy in
      seeing so many of my hires grow and expand their lives with that company
      or others. When that season ended for me, there was something that had
      been on my mind for the last three years, coding. I heard about SheCodes
      from the meetings for AVIXA and decided to enjoy my children this summer
      and learn to code.
